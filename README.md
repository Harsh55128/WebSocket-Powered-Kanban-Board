# 📝 WebSocket-Powered Kanban Board
### Real-Time Task Management System with WebSockets & Automated Testing

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **real-time Kanban Board application** built to demonstrate modern frontend architecture, WebSocket-based synchronization, and robust automated testing.

Users can create, update, delete, categorize, prioritize, and move tasks across workflow stages while **instantly syncing changes across multiple browser sessions** using **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**.

The project focuses heavily on **code quality, scalability, and testing discipline**.

## 🔌 WebSocket Implementation

### Events Used

| Event Name     | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| task:create   | Create a new task                     |
| task:update   | Update priority or category           |
| task:move     | Move task between columns             |
| task:delete   | Delete a task                         |
| sync:tasks    | Sync all tasks for new connections    |

### Benefits

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Testing was treated as a **first-class citizen** in this project.

### Unit Testing

**Tools:** Vitest + React Testing Library  
**Location:** `src/tests/unit/`

Covered:
- Component rendering
- Priority change logic
- Category change logic
- Controlled form inputs
- State updates

---

### Integration Testing

**Tools:** Vitest  
**Location:** `src/tests/integration/`

Covered:
- WebSocket event handling
- Drag-and-drop behavior
- State synchronization

---

### End-to-End Testing

**Tools:** Playwright  
**Location:** `src/tests/e2e/`

Covered:
- Creating tasks
- Updating priority and category
- Dragging tasks between columns
- Real-time sync across multiple tabs

> Note: E2E tests are optional and excluded from production builds.
